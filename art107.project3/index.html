  <h1>The True Price of Food</h1>
  <p> My research about food waste led to the subject of migrant workers and their low wages. Many migrants workers who harvest the produce we eat are paid below the minimum wage line. Some aren’t paid hourly and instead paid by the amount they harvest, such as in bins or containers. As a result of being paid poorly, many migrant workers are unable to afford the products that they harvested in stores.
So for this project, I wanted to create an interactive website that showcased produce that many migrant workers are unable to afford despite harvesting them. The layout of the website is inspired by catalogs from the ’80s and ’90s. You can see the item and the average retail price of the product in the U.S. When you click on the item you learn more about the harvesting process of that produce.
